# Indholdskanalen channel filter
This module provides a new custom field type that allows the users to create the
slide channel node by filter existing content in OG's, taxonomies and nodes.

So basically it allows content reference in a user friendly way base on IK's
architecture. It also utilises auto completion and multi valued fields.

# Menu callbacks
It uses the following paths for auto completion callbacks.

  /ajax/ik/autocomplete/<type>
